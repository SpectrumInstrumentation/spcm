3_dds_ramp_single_carrier.py

Ramp single carrier - Use the ramping functionality to do a long and slow frequency as well as amplitude ramp

Example for analog replay cards (AWG) for the the M4i and M4x card-families with installed DDS option.

See the README file in the parent folder of this examples directory for information about how to use this example.
