5_dds_timed_frequency_changes.py

Single static carrier with a frequency change after time - This example shows the DDS functionality with 1 carrier with a 100 MHz 
frequency, that changes to 200 MHz after a time of 3 seconds and then again to 300 MHz after 3 seconds.

Example for analog replay cards (AWG) for the the M4i and M4x card-families with installed DDS option.

See the README file in the parent folder of this examples directory for information about how to use this example.
