2_dds_multiple_static_carriers.py

Multiple static carriers - this example shows the DDS functionality with 20 carriers with individual but fixed frequencies on one channel. 

Example for analog replay cards (AWG) for the the M4i and M4x card-families with installed DDS option.

See the README file in the parent folder of this examples directory for information about how to use this example.
